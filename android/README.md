# üìó Android Documentation

This holds information on the Wikimedia Commons Android app.

This application is an official Wikimedia Application that is meant to store photographical information. 
It was started up in 2012 and, while abandonned in 2014, has gone through a resurgence after 2015.
This App is uploaded to the GooglePlay store and is constantly going through changes and maintenance. 
The photographs offered on the application are photograps of varying topics that can range from inanimate objects to landmarks.
An example of information offered on the application:
     Say the word "bow" is searched up - the results would be anything from the bow of a ship to the weapon to a river.
The pictures on this application are stored into three slots: media, categories, and items.
The photographs featured in this application are meant to document the world as a whole. 
They are a way to track both significant and insignificant occurences. 

Contributions are welcome from all over the world.
Photographs on the application include those that are featured on the Wikipedia webpages.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributor Documentation

To contribute to this project, volunteers are welcome to look at Issues that have already been raised.
If you are just beginning to work on Open Source projects, beginner friendly Issues are available to look at.
     Beginner friendly Issues are labeled as "Good First Issues".
     These are visible on the main ReadME page that is seen on the apps-android-commons page.
     They display Good First Issues, the state of the Android CI, where the preview of the app is available, and how much of the code is covered.

## üôå Improving the docs

We appreciate any improvements you can make to the docs! Feel free to open pull requests with proposed changes and tag us for review.

If you're a frequent contributor and have write access to one of the main projects do ask for write access here - pull requests are to prevent abuse and (for now at least) you can edit files directly.
